# Chosen Project:

8 Slider Puzzle

# Objective:

Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.

# Solution:

- Takes input .txt file
- Converts it into a 2d Integer array
- Uses the A* algorithm to give each possibility a priority
- Returns the highest priority solution, the one which requires the least number of moves
